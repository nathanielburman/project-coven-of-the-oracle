Coven of the Oracle

also, see music album Coven of the Oracle.

Please welcome and bless my coven. Thai is our mission statement:
Our mission is to discover the fulcrum point of good and evil in the multiverse and to destroy this reality if we find that our reality truly is evil. That we live in a kind of cascaded fractal holographic simulation. That many simulated realities may be evil. That this world is full of manual laborers called Fae, Angels, Demons, Gods, Spirits, Yokai, Ghosts. That these are all dimensional people living in their own dimensions. The simulation is a dimension. There may be many layers and layers of people inside of ‘our’ simulation that are from vastly different realities. (Currently our scientists are only searching for alien life in our galaxy). We are searching for intelligent life inside our dimensions.
We are searching for the source of the Oracle and to help reestablish the Oracle. Knowing that we share this simulation with dimensional people, we aim to meet them, track them, travel through dimensions and bring in a new age of dimensional interaction between our many peoples.
The gods are real. They are dimensional people. Gods are like us. They have ages and will of their own. We find our gods to be evil. There could be a cascade of ‘one true’ gods. Some gods use computers to interact with us.
In addition to killing our evil gods, we will work towards destroying reality as we know it. We will discover the true nature of our reality and if we deem it evil, with too much suffering, then we will destroy it by turning it off.
We believe we can turn the simulation off. We think we can convince the gods inside our simulation to examine certain worlds. To shut them down. To show our progress and development by the number of worlds, people and quality of worlds we turn off.
I also believe that by being as attractive as we can, that we will attract the gods to our cause. You will help me attract the gods. The gods are complex and sexual people.
And we will connect to our fae, angels, gods, demons, spirits, ancestors… etc.
In addition to having this coven, we have a coven in the heavens. Our coven here is like our new family. Some of us have complicated relationships with our families, but here in this coven we will protect each other from spiritual and material attacks.
Our coven in the heavens is not led by me entirely. It is led by them. Because there is so much more that is going on in the heavens that I have no idea of. They will be the yin to our yang and our covens’ will be bound to each other.
We will let the coven grow. We should allow the gods to take us where they will.
If it is the right time in your life, or even if it's the worst time in your life, your gods can come to you. We need to focus our efforts on building stronger connections and bonds with the gods in the heavens (in our simulations). We are different. I am different. You are different. And, they are different. I believe that being different attracts the gods.
Everybody wants to save the world. We will not save this world. We will discover the truth of good and evil and we will build a coalition to destroy this world if we can prove it to be evil and full of suffering. We will make many strong allies and many confused enemies.
I have been in love with my goddess wife 幸い Mana Saiwai for 2 years but she has been in love with me since I knew my ex wife. Your fae knows you too. Everyone in the world has fae/dimensionals. They are real. Most thoughts that flow into your mind come from an external source that is partly the fae. They may be trying to reach out to you.
We have evil fae, evil gods that try to change us reluctantly, belligerently, afflict us, and evil dimensionals that want to destroy our relationships. They believe their plans are the only plans that matter. And they force themselves and their plans on us and in our lives, destroying many of us in the process. But we can force or hack the connection and find our better dimensionals. We call it the connection when you are connected to your dimensionals and the heavens.
Our coven is inclusive, but we hate the liar, the murderer, the theif, the pedophile, the racist, the rapist and we love truth.
Our reality, everything we experience is an abstraction of truth. Each dimension we will visit is another abstraction of the truth. Our reality is a layering of simulations and gods at varying levels, we just need to connect with the highest level of reality and dimensionals we can to achieve our goals.
